This package implements a rectangle packing algorithm suitable for
tracking the placement of multiple rectangles inside a larger one. It
is useful for cases such as placing the contents of multiple windows
on a larger backing store texture for a compositing window manager;
placing multiple rasterized strings in a texture map for quick
rendering to the screen; and many other situations where it is useful
to carve up a larger texture into smaller pieces dynamically. <P>
