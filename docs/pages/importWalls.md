# Import Walls Data

## Create Station and Vector Report

First you must create a Station and Vector Report with Walls, so that Breakout
can use the station positions calculated by Walls loop closure.

With the project open in walls, select the root of the project or book you would
like to import, and click the **Compile** or **Review** button.

Once the branch is compiled, go to **File > Station and Vector Reports...**

In the dialog that appears, use the options pictured below, and make sure the
output file is in the same directory as the `.wpj` file you would like to
import.

Click **OK** to save the `.LST` file with station positions.

## Import data into Breakout

Now in Breakout, go to **File > Import > Import Walls data...**

Breakout will ask you to select the files to import. Select both your `.WPJ`
project file and the `.LST` file saved in the last step. (To select the second
file, hold Ctrl and click on Windows/Linux or âŒ˜ and click on Mac OS):

Click **OK**. Breakout will show a progress bar while reading the Walls files.
Once it is done, the a results dialog will appear, showing any errors and
warnings about the imported data.

You can click the **Data** tab to see the shots Breakout imported:

It's also good to verify that station positions were imported by selecting the
**NEV** option in the **Data** tab. _Any stations for which the **Northing**,
**Easting**, and **Elevation** columns are blank will have their position
computed by Breakout using very basic calculations without loop closure._

If you are satisfied with the imported data, click **Add to Current Project**.
You will see a progress bar at the top of the window that indicates it is
parsing the survey data and creating the 3D model. Once it is finished, if
everything goes well, the data should appear in the 3D view.
