;This is NOT a real measurement. When included in the compilation,
;it constrains Well #2 to a point 10 meters north of its normal
;adjusted location. Its purpose is only to demonstrate SVG morphing.
;When this tree item is attached, a merged SVG export will require
;a feature adjustment since 10 meters exceeds a user-specified
;tolerance setting for a station's movement (0.3 meters by default).
;When it's not attached, no adjustment occurs since the SVG source
;file (KAUA-NM_w2d_mrg.svg) already matches the survey database.
