newProjectInfoDialog.message=Breakout autosaves your visualization settings and survey data as you make changes.  After you click OK, you will be prompted for a location for the new project settings file, followed by a location for the new project survey file.  Multiple projects may share a survey file; if so changes to the survey while made while viewing one project will affect the survey for the other project as well.
